        <h3>The Orange History</h3>
        <p>In 2013 my sister and I started Orange to make sure Ugandan ladies had quality products from the US and UK, at affordable prices. We understand the importance of getting the right size and style of bra. Being comfortable is not a luxury and looking fabulous not a ‘one off’ thing. To us a happy customer is a happy business.

Since starting we have opened the Park Royal Arcade, Kampala Road and Quality Shopping Mall, Naalya shops, and now the website and App! We have also hosted dozens of fun bridal showers with brides and friends coming from the wonderful Sisters Bridal Shop.

All of our products are new and are sourced through the US and UK, ensuring they come directly from the brand manufacturers and through their respective countries quality control standards.

We look forward to helping you and if you are in Kampala, if you register with us we can deliver!
